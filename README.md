# Rock, Paper Scissors Game

[picture of Screen Responsiveness](documentation-images/Screen-responsiveness.png)

The Rock, Paper, Scissors Game was created to allow British children of primary school age (between 5 and 10 years) to exercise their fine motor skills by interacting with a computer game. It is also a fun way for them to experience how games can also be a matter of chance and not always just skill. To demonstrate this, I choose to create a typical children's game of rock, paper scissors, which many primary school aged children in England have played before. Children will also learn a bit about what the properties of rock, paper and scissors can do in combination with one another. This game allows a player to play against the computer.


## Features 

### Existing Features


- __Heading__

[picture of Heading section](documentation-images/Header.png)

  - The heading "Rock, Paper, Scissors Game" is large and bold. This is to make it easy for children to read. The heading is also written in the Comic Neue font-type, which is child-friendly. This font type is not highly stylised, making it easier and clearer to read.

- __Game Area__

[picture of Homepage section](documentation-images/Rock-paper-scissors-homepage.png)

  - This game area has a "Please Choose!" sub-heading, signalling to children that they should choose one of the buttons below the "Please Choose!" subheading. Underneath this sits the three buttons for rock, paper and scissors in a horizontol row. Additionally the Reset button sits next to the three buttons. Children can choose one of the first three buttons ("Rock, "Paper" or "Scissors") in order to play a round against the computer. Each button has a small icon of the object that it signals beside the words "Rock", "Paper" and "Scissors" in order to show children who cannot read the button text so well which button that they are pressing. 

The reset button can be pressed at anytime throughout the game to take the player back to the game's homepage. There the scores will go back to 0 for both the computer and the player. This allows players to start the game again at any time that they would like to.

- __Score Area__

  -  The score area is primarily for the player to know their score against the computer's score. In this area, there is a section to the left with a yellow background showing "Your Score", which is the score of the player. To the right sits a section with a blue background showing the "Computer Score". Again it has pictures of the three images of hands representing a rock, a piece of paper and a pair of scissors. These colors are in blue and yellow because they are primary colours. These are colours that many children of primary school going age would be familiar with and know the names of. Primary colours are also child friendly because children like and see bright primary colours more clearly than dark and muted colours. These colours are familiar to the children and offers the warmth of familiarity for them without too much distraction from learning how to play a new game.

  When the player selects a button of one of the objects (rock, paper or scissors), the computer also randomly generates an object to play aginst the player. An image of the selected player object and the randomly selected computer object show up on screen. If the player wins that round then a "Player Wins!" message shows on screen and the player gets 1 point. If the computer wins that round then a "Computer Wins!" message shows on screen and the computer gets 1 point. If the computer and player both select the same object by chance, then a "Tie!" message shows on screen and both the player and computer get 1 point each. With every round played the socres are increased of the player, the computer or both player and computer where appropriate.


_ Footer Area _

The footer holds the rules of the game. The rules of the game allow children to know what object (rock, paper or scissors) can be used in combination with the other objects to win a round of the game. This has a slightly educational moment, which allows children to imagine what the objects can do in combination with one another. The footer background colour is in red, whilst the text is white. These are bright primary colour just like the colours above in the score section. Primary colours were again used for the footer for the same reasons that primary colours were used in the score area (see score area section above).  

### Features Left to Implement

- I would add a feature for players to play one another and not only to play against the computer.

## Testing 

[picture of Lighthouse Testing](documentation-images/Rock-paper-scissors-Lighthouse-test.png)

I confirmed that the accessibility score and fonts and colours are easy to see and read by running it though Lighthouse in dev tools. The Lighthouse accessibility score is 97.

I tested this game in the Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers and the game worked fine with all of them.

I confirmed that the webpage is responsive between the screen sizes of:

320px-480px
481px-768px
769px-1024
1025px-1200px
1201px and above

### Unfixed Bugs

There were no unfixed bugs in the code, since there were no bugs found.

## Deployment

This website was deployed to the GitHub page. These were the steps taken.
1) Go to the github repository.
2) Select ”Settings” at the top of the page.
3) Select ”Pages” from the left hand column on the page.
4) Under the ”Source” heading, select the ”Deploy from a branch” option.
